        <h2 class="card-title">About FWW</h2>
        <p class="card-text">Fostering Without Walls is a 501c3 that was created early in 2019.
            After starting Red Hawk Ranch, a group home for siblings
            removed by the Department of Child Safety, we realized
            many of the kids needs were not fulfilled by the State.
            The board members of FWW all believe in giving back
            to the community and making a difference in this world.
            We have a tender heart for kids and want to make their
            lives better while they are going through this traumatic
            time.

        <h2 class="card-title">Treasurer: Linnea Tow</h2>
        <p class="card-text">I am the mother of 3 grown daughters, 2 step daughters
          and 8 grandchildren.
          I began working for Dr. Ronald Newth and Dr. David Atwood in 1971 for
          approximately 5 years. I worked for Dr. Atwood through 1999 as a front
          office scheduler and pre-testing technician. Both of these were Optometric
          practices where I worked both full and part time over the years. In these
          practices, I wore many hats, one of them being the back-up optician.
          I began working for Dr. M. Kent Moore, M.D. from 1999 through 2009.
          I was an Ophthalmic technician and also worked front office interacting
          with patients as needed.
          I’ve always had a passion for cards and played social bridge for many
          years, establishing long time friendships. I became more interested
          in competitive bridge beginning in 1996. As with most non-profit organization,
          this one is very volunteer oriented. I worked as the Hospitality Chairperson,
          during tournaments, as much as I could while I was working. I had always said
          I would be willing to be on the Unit 351 board, which consists of 12 members,
          when I no longer worked. Unit 351 reaches the entire east valley with
          approximately 750 members. I was elected Treasurer in 2009 until the present.
          I have the fiduciary responsibility with our checking and Premier Savings account
          as well as managing and creating a yearly budget of approximately 100K.
          We have previously sponsored 1 Regional tournament yearly earning approximately
          100K and 1 Sectional Tournament earning 60K which I have the responsibility of
          dispersing and managing funds
